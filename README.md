# NUMPY
# Advanced NumPy Demonstration Script

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains a single Python script, `advanced_numpy_demo.py`, which showcases a wide variety of NumPy features and idioms in one cohesive example. It is designed both as a learning resource and as a reference for advanced array operations, linear algebra, random sampling, stride tricks, Fourier analysis, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate core and advanced NumPy functionality  
- Illustrate how to combine NumPy with scikit‑learn for a mini data pipeline  
- Serve as a drop‑in tutorial for building high‑performance numerical code

## 🔍 Features Covered

1. **Array Creation & Data Types**  
2. **Reshaping & Broadcasting**  
3. **Universal Functions (ufuncs)** (e.g., trigonometric, comparison)  
4. **Advanced Indexing & Slicing** (fancy indexing, boolean masks)  
5. **Structured Arrays** for heterogeneous records  
6. **Masked Arrays** to hide unwanted entries  
7. **Linear Algebra** (`inv`, `eig`)  
8. **Random Sampling & Statistics** (normal distributions, histograms)  
9. **Stride Tricks** (`sliding_window_view`)  
10. **Einstein Summation** (`np.einsum`)  
11. **Fourier Transforms** (`np.fft`)  
12. **Polynomial Evaluation & Fitting** (`np.poly1d`, `np.polyfit`)  
13. **Integration with scikit‑learn**: standardization and synthetic classification
